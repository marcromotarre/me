        The first goal of a UI developer is to display content.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        To display that data we are going to use HTML and we will use a layout
        and a render engine. We will be using a kind of list of ordered elements
        and those elements will be displayed on the screen. This list of
        elements (objects) is called DOM.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h6">Rendering HTML under the hood</Typography>

      <Typography variant="h4">Goal 2 - </Typography>
    </>
